Mergesort:
-divide array into two halves 
-recursively sort each half 
-merge two halves 

Mergesort uses extra space proportional to N 
Use Insertion Sort for small subarrays (< 7 items)
Mergesort has too much overhead for tiny subarrays 

A stable sort preserves the relative order of items with
equal keys 

Which sorts are stable?
-Insertion sort and merge sort (not selection sort or shell sort)
