Equality Tests 
-Reflective: x.equals(x) is true 
-Symmetric x.equals(y) iff y.equals(x) 
-Transitive if x.equals(y) and y.equals(z)  then x.equals(z) 

Default implementation (x == y) //< do x and y refer to the same object? 

Standard recipe for testing Equality
    -optimization for reference Equality
    -check against null
    -check that two objects are of the same type and cast 
    -compare each significant field:
        -if field is a primitive type use == 
        -if field is an object use equals() 
        -if field is an array, apply to each entry
